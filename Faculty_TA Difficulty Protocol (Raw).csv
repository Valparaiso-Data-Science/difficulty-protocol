Students are learning more about how to manipulate scales (especially color) after having previously expressed confusion about what scales were. Many students asked questions about data cleaning and data wrangling, which is good because that is what we will cover next week. ","I was surprised at how many students were eager to use GitHub, even though I haven't told them how it works yet. My approach is to let them feel the pain of collaborating without GitHub first, and then use that pain as motivation to learn GitHub next time. I'm wondering if our rigorous GitHub proselytizing is starting to pay dividends. "
